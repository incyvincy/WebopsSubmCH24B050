### GraphQL vs REST

- **REST** exposes multiple endpoints (one per resource).
- **GraphQL** uses a single endpoint with flexible queries.

#### Pros of GraphQL:
- Precise data fetching (no over/under-fetching)
- Strongly typed schema
- Easier versioning

#### Pros of REST:
- Simpler to cache
- Easy to use for simple APIs
